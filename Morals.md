## Morals

### A need for reinforcement based morals

We need to consider designing systems and robots in such a way that, they feel pain, undergo depression, feel fear etc.

A robot should feel a heartache(not literally/necessarily a heart but a feedback mechanism) when some life(especially human) is hurt.
