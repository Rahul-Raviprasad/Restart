# Restart

A repo of storing data sets, and action items, plans, better design of current systems and roadmaps to tackle and survive an Apocalyptic event. My main interest is in Artificial Intelligence takeover. But in my opinion many of the items should also apply to other Apocalyptic scenarios including not limited to zombie(quite popular for some reason), meteor strike etc.

#### Disclaimer:
I have to first start out by saying, this is perhaps going to be one of the most stupid sounding repository to many people. Also I don't feel in any way that there can be an Apocalyptic event in near future.

#### Aim and objective:-
1. Use this as a learning tool to assess and design systems. (systems here vary from computer architecture to real life policies, architecture, economics etc)
2. Collect data and learning from it. (Find something important in that process.)
