#### Disclaimer:
I have to first start out by saying, this is perhaps going to be one of the most stupid sounding repository to many people. Also I don't feel in any way that there can be an Apocalyptic event in near future.

#### Aim and objective:-
1. Use this as a learning tool to assess and design systems. (systems here vary from computer architecture to real life policies, architecture, economics etc)
2. Collect data and learning from it. (Find something important in that process.)
