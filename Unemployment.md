## Unemployment due to Artificial Intelligence

Case 1: consider a scenario where a robot replaces the job of a person, who is doing repetitive jobs.
The argument against it has been that, jobs lost in one area will create opportunities in others. An example being before alarm clocks came, there were people whose entire job was to knock at customers windows to wake them up.

Now the important question that this raises is
Will equal amount of jobs be created in the economy?
What happens when most of the value adding and fundamental to life activities are done by robots?
eg. farming, cooking, teaching etc

Case 2: people who are in creative fields or artistic field believe they can't be replaced
Is it really so?
Maybe at a particular level of mastery it is perhaps not possible soon. But the advantage a computer would have, is to do a brute force analysis and having multiple trials and errors(iterations), and can beat small players or will drive people away from the field.
