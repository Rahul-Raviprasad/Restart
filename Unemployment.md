## Unemployment due to Artificial Intelligence

Case 1: consider a scenario where a robot replaces the job of a person, who is doing repetitive jobs.
The argument against it has been that, jobs lost in one area will create opportunities in others. An example being before alarm clocks came, there were people whose entire job was to knock at customers windows to wake them up.

Now the important question that this raises is
Will equal amount of jobs be created in the economy?
What happens when most of the value adding and fundamental to life activities are done by robots?
eg. farming, cooking, teaching etc

Important to note is the metrics to measure this.
Also important is that the metric be both QUALITATIVE as it is QUANTITATIVE.

What does this imply?
An example(perhaps bad) would be of professional photographer who knows a lot of skills, say like exposure to light, setting dimension as to what should be in the frame, how to focus correctly on the subject and more. We know today how much a pocket cell phone has advanced and with extremely fast computing perhaps one day editing the photographs would be in real time by computers(AI).

The point with case one would be that all these jobs, which many professional underwent training in (digital photography, UX designers, editing professionals, animation etc) would loose their jobs or it would be so easy a child would be able to do it.

Will these professional still have jobs?
Will they be challenging? (people don't only work for money)
Will a photographer with 15 years of experience, suddenly or gradually without many client be able to change professions?


Case 2: people who are in creative fields or artistic field believe they can't be replaced
Is it really so?
Maybe at a particular level of mastery it is perhaps not possible soon. But the advantage a computer would have, is to do a brute force analysis and having multiple trials and errors(iterations), and can beat small players or will drive people away from the field.

## Universal basic income

The moment we reach a point where all jobs have been automated or majority of what can be has been automated, then what happens?

In todays world we give respect to "Merits". Think about it what are these merits?
* A programmer who has mastered a programming language and understand the fundamentals of computer science, feels he/she is smart, thier acquistion of this knowledge makes useful to their organizations. say this programmer takes 4 years of engg. + 4 years in industry to feel this way. He earns a good pay and beleive, he deserve it.

* A business man invest in a firm which he believes in and reaps the benefit. He only through his research, interest and risk appetitie could pursue this venture and assuming this opportunity isn't restricted to other normal peolpe.

* A farmer works day and night to get the food.

* There is a bum, who is not interested in working hard and earning.

In all these cases there are markets out there and economic consumption and demand exists, and "Hard" and "Smart" work both is needed to fulfill this today. What happens when these merits start becoming insignificant.
* A robot which is smarter than you, or can code/automate stuff based on business inputs directly
* Should you be paid for your risk appetite alone?
* A robot can micromanage the plant and more stronger and faster. it can already kill any blue collar job.
* Should a bum be treated equally to a scientist from ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) after AI takeover?

Assuming society, democracy, freedom, government (all institutions) remain intact and somewhat similar to present day, but the only problem remaining is unemployment. How do have transaction? If we use money, how do we generate and consume?
